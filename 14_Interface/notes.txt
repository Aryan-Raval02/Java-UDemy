~> What is Interface ?
    Interfcae is used to define blueprint for classes.
    purpose of interface is polymorphism

    'interface' keyword is used to create Interface.

    interface contains :
        Abstract Method
        Default Method
        Static Methods
        Constants

    java does not support multiple classes in inheritance.
    Interface allow you to define what a class must do.

~> Multiple Inheritance Vs Interface



~> Example of Interface

    interface Animal {
        void eat(); // abstract method
        default void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
        }   
    }

    class Dog implements Animal {
        public void eat() {
            System.out.println("Dog eats food.");
        }
    }

~> Do's and Don'ts Interface :
    All methods in an interface are implicitly public and abstract (except static and default).
    Variables in interfaces are implicitly public, static, and final.
    You cannot create an instance of an interface.
    You can create only reference of interface.
    Interface implements to class not extends.
    Compulsory override all method from interface to class.
    interface extends other interface.
    we can access static properties of interface through interface name.
    default method is not neccessary to override but we can override.
    we can define private method but cant call it from outside.
