~> What is an Abstract Class ?
        An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated.
        It is used to provide a base for subclasses to extend and implement abstract methods.
        It can have both abstract (unimplemented) and concrete (implemented) methods.

~> Example of Abstract Class ?

    Ex:
    abstract class AbstractClass
    {
        //abstract method (no body)
        abstract public void display();

        //concrete method (has body)
        public void m1(){
            sop("M1");
        }
    }


~> Why Abstract Class ?


~> Key Points :
        abstract keyword is used for declare abstract class.
        Method which has not body is called abstract methods.
        A class contains at least one abstract method then compulsory to declare class as abstract.
        Abstract class does not use to create object.

        When a class is extends from abstract class it also a abstract class.
        to become concrete class all abstract method from parent class must be overriden.

        final and abstract class is illegal combination beacuse final class cant be inherited.
        final and abstract method is illegal combination beacuse final method cant be overriden.
        static and abstarct class is illegal beacuse abstract class properties cant be access without extending.
        static and abstarct method is illegal beacuse abstarct method cant be acces without extending.

        Any abstarct class we can declare a reference but cant create a object.
