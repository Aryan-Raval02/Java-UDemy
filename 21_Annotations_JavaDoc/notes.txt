~> Java Documentation Tools :

    Java Documentation is full detailed documentation of any version of java.

    Java Doc Tags :

    @author : Who created java doc.
    @version : Version of define class.
    @since : When it is Created.
    @see : Reference of this class

    @param : what parameters it take?
    @return : What value it returing.
    @throws : what exception it is throwing.
    @exception : what exception is related
    @deprecated : whether it is deprecated or not
    @code : we can show logic of method

    @link :  if you want to provide link to other resource.
    @value : if you declare any value to static variable 
    @serial : if you want to declare serial id.

~> Annotations :
    Annotations is to provide metadata to class.

    Built-in Annotations :
        1. Applied to code :
            @override : It declare where method is override.
            @Deprecated : When we require a Deprecated data.(Not to use it)
            @FunctionlInterface : Interface having a single function then we can declare FunctionalInterface.
            @SuppressWarnings : When we require to hide warning then use SuppressWarning. such as, deprecated, unchecked.
            @SafeVarargs : it is use for variable argument method to remove warning.

        2. Applied to other Annotations :
            
            Creating own Annotations we use @interface.

            Example :
            @interface MyAnno {}

            In, User defined Annotation.
            Normally interface have abstract methods but in Annotation have Elements of Annotations.

            We define more than one Elements of annotations then we provide all the annotations in Program.


            @Retension(RetensionPolicy.Elements) : use for Reflexsion of metadata.
            @Documented : Means this document available in java Documentations.
            @Target(value=ElementType.Elements) : It is use for declaring for single attribute like constructor, variable, class, etc. we define array of elements.
            @Inherited : means annotations are use for sub classes.
            @Repeatable : Means we use annotations for multiple times.
