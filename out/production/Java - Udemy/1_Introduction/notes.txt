JDK : A software development kit used to develop java applications.
      JDK = JRE + Dev Tools (like Compiler, Debugger, etc.)
      Tools name : javac, java, javadoc, jdb, jar, javap, etc.

JRE : A package that provides environment to run java program.
      JRE = JVM + Core Libraries and classes + Deployment Technologies
      We can run a Java program with JRE, but we can't develop or compile Java code with it.

JVM : Convert byte code into machine code for our system.
      "Write Once, Run Anywhere"
      Each OS has its own JVM implementation ,but it runs platform independent bytecode.

javac : Is the compiler to compile .java file into .class file.
        Ex : javac file_name.java

java : Is the java launcher for executing .class file.
       Ex : java file_name


[] Skeleton of Java Program :
class Class_name{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}

Main method must be static public.
Main method should not be return anything.
In main method formal argument compulsory but actual argument not compulsory.

[] Important :
-> java.lang.* package automatically imported in our program.
-> when one class is public in a file then file name should be same as public class name.
-> If we execute one class which has not main method then we will get Runtime Exception as "main method not found in class Class_name".

[] Read data from keyboard with Scanner Class :
-> Scanner class is use to take input of varies type of data.
-> Scanner class available in java.util package.
-> Methods :
            nextInt()
            nextFloat()
            nextDouble()
            next()
            nextLine()
            nextByte()
            nextShort()
            nextLong()
            nextBoolean()
            hasNextInt()
            hasNextFloat()

-> When Scanner class is not imported then compile time error "Cannot find Symbol".
-> When we are providing Unexpected input then it will show RE : "Input Mismatch Exception".
