Static :
    Static keyword is used for representing information metadata(a class).
    
    ~> Static Variables
        if you only data related to a class then declare static variable.
        static data member belong to a class.
        static data member is shared data preference.
        static variable create and present in inside Method Area.
    
    ~> Static Methods
        if data need some processing and if you do some computations then declare static method.
        static method only access static properties of a class.
    
    ~> Static Nested Class
        if you have lot of data and make it to group together and made as static nested class.
    
    ~> Static Blocks
        Whenever a class is loaded static block execute before constructor calling.
        any number of static block will be declsre.
    
Final :
    ~> final variable :
            final variable is the constant.
            it decare as capital letter.
            when initialise final variable we can not modify it.
            three types to initialise final variable :
                1. at the time of variable decalration
                2. in the block/static block.
                3. in the constructor.

    ~> final methods :
            final method can not be override.
            we should not redefine final methods.
            final methods restrict to override.

    ~> final class :
            final class can not extended.
            we can not borrow the features of final class.

~> Singleton class :
        a class which can create only a single object.
        more than one objects there are not allowed to create.
