Programmer is write the program.
User is use the program.

Exception is Runtime Error.

Types of Error :
    Syntax Error            Programmer          Compiler
    Logical Error           Programmer          Tracing/Debugger
    Runtime Error           User                

~> Exception Handling :
    Runtime error should be handle by programmer is called Exception Handling.
    Giving messages instead of errors.

    Bad input
    Unavailability of resources

~> How to Handle Exception :
    when runtime error found then this line to program terminated abnormally from line.

    try : if some line has chance of runtime error then we write those line into cache block.
          so, we handle the exception.

    catch : if try block find the exception then only catch block execute.
            and correspond Exception class is called.

    finally :   finally block is optional.
                if there is exception or not but finally block is alway executed.
                it is use for clean up program.
    
    Exception handling makes our program more readable.

~> Exception Class :
    [] Exception    
        1. ClassNotFoundException   (Checked)
        2. IOException              (Checked)
        3. InterruptedException     (Checked)
        4. NumberFormatException    (Checked)
        5. RuntimeException         (Unchecked)
            i.      ArithmeticException
            ii.     IndexOutOfBoundException
            iii.    NullPointerException

There is two types of Exception :
    Checked Exception   : Compulsory to handle Exception(try...catch)
    Unchecked Exception : can be Handle or not

    class Exception{
        string getMessage()     //e.getMessage()
        string toString()       //e      automatically called toString().
        void printStackTrace()
    }


[] User Defined Exception :
    User defined Exception must be extended from Exception Class.
    Override toString() methos in user defined exception.

[] throw Vs throws :
    throw is used to create object of Exception and throw exception explicilty.
    throws declare that method or class can be throw exception.
    This two keywords are used with together.
