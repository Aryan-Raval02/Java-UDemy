Loops :
    means repeat statements untill reach output or number of time.


~> While Loop : repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
    prefix loop
    first check the condition
    when condition is true then execute loop body
    syntax :
    while(condition){
        //statements
    }

~> Do-While Loop : executes a block of code at least once, and then repeats the execution as long as a specified condition is true.
    postfix loop
    first execute body after check condition
    when condition is false at first time then loop body execute at least one time
    syntax :
    do{
        //statements
    }while(condition);

~> For Loop : executes a block of code a fixed number of time.
    Most frequently use loop
    initialisation done only one time
    all three parameters are optional
    syntax :
    for(initialisation;condition;increment/decrement){
        //statements
    }

~> Nested Loop : loop inside loop
