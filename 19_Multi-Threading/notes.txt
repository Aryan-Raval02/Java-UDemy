Multi - Programming :
    Running multiple program on a single computer is Multi-Programming.
    [] There are two types of Multi - Programming :
        1. Multi - User : More than one users use single machine simultaneously.
        2. Multi - Tasking : Only one user can running more then one task simultaneously. 
                            Multi - Threading

~> Multi Threading :
    Windows ,MacOS
    (what is idle in multithreading?)

    Multiple Threads are in program.
    CPU execute threads alternatively as if user assume that he use simultaneously.

~> Why Multi Threading :



~> Control Flow of a Program :



~> Thread in Java :
    Thread Class : When we reuire multi threading in our class then extend Thread class.
    Runnable Class : When we require multi threaidng in our class and we extend some other class then implements Runnable interface.

    Whenever we use Thread class or Runnable interface , we override run() method.
    Inside run() we write our thread logics.
    run() is starting point of Thread.
    Only one method in Thread class or Runnable interface is run(). 


~> States of Thread :

    When one thread is terminated then we can not re-start. we have to create new thread.

    Formal states of Thread :

       start    run        end
    new -> ready -> running -> terminated

    When Thread is running and we require stop for somtimes or shared refernce for some task.
          wait    notify
    running -> wait -> running

    When Thread is running and we require to delay for fix time.
        sleep/wait
    running -> timed wait -> running

    when Thread is running and we reuire some Input/Ouput.
        require I/O
    running -> blocked -> running
