~> OSI Model : (Open System Interconncetion)

    OSI Model describes that how information from a Software application in one computer to software application to other computer.
    OSI Model based on some Layers :

        Application Layer   : 
            It provide service to user.

        Presentation Layer  : 
            It responsible for translation, compression and encryption.

        Session Layer       : 
            It is used to establish, manage and terminate the sessions.

        Transport Layer     : 
            It provides reliable message delivery from process to process. (Connection)

        Network Layer       :
            It responsible to moving packets from source to destination.
            It provides Logical address.
            (IP Address).

        Data Link Layer     :
            It is used for error free transfer of data.
            It Provides Physical Address.
            (MAC Address).

        Physical Layer      : 
            It provide physical medium through which data are transmitted.

~> TCP/IP :

    Application Layer   :   HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP

    Transport Layer     :   TCP / UDP

    Network Layer       :   IPv4  IPv6

    Network Access Layer:   Ethernet


~> How to develop a client-server program ?

    Echo server commonly use for client-server program.
    If a client send message to a server then server backs return message to client.

    Locally, MAC address is used to transfer data.
    In Internet, IP address is used to transfer data.

    Port No : 0 - 65535
              0 - 1023 are reserved.

    Developing Client Program, we have Socket class.
    Developing Server Program, we have ServerSocket class.
