[] important :

    Responsibily of Programmer how data write to file and receive from file.

~> Files Vs Databse

    In file, We can not organise big data easily.
    This process is complex beacuse we can store big data in file but when we retrieve it difficult to access.

    In Databse, We can organise big data easily and retrieve it.
    Database Program is used to store permanent data to HDD(Disk).
    Database organise data in form of tabular.

~> What is Database ?
    Database is collection of Table.
    For retrieving data from table, we use Structure Query Language.

~> Famous Databases :

    Oracle
    MYSQL
    SQLServer
    SQLite

~> Databse Terminology :

    Relation : 
        A Relation is a table in a Relational Database.
        Relation = Table

        We have one table as Student.
        Then, Student is relation.

    Record :
        Top of table we find description of table. This Known as Schema of table.
        Based on this Schema we insert records into table.
        Record means data in row(tuple) related to Schema of Table.

    Field :
        All the column in Data Table is known as Field(Attribute) of Table.

    Primary Key : 
        Primary Key is Column of Table which contains Unique Value and Not Null.
        Primary Key is a column in a table that uniquely identifies each row in table.

    Relationship : 
        A Relationship is an association between two or more tables based on common attributes.
        Typically using Primary and Foreign Key.

        Type of Relationship :
            1 : 1
            1 : N
            M : N

    Foreign Key :
        A Foreign key is a column in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.

    Constraints :
        Primary key and Foreign Key are  Constraints.


[] SQLite :

    ~> DDL (Data Definition/Description Language)
        CREATE  
        DROP    
        ALTER   
        TRUNCATE
        RENAME  
    
    ~> DML (Data Manipulation Language)
        INSERT
        DELETE
        UPDATE

    ~> Query Language:
        SELECT (LIMIT, OFFSET)
        FROM 
        JOIN
        WHERE (<,<=,>,>=,=,<>,AND,OR,NOT, LIKE(_,%), IN, BETWEEN...AND...,NOT IN)
        ORDER BY (desc)
        GROUP BY 
        HAVING (Aggregate Function : COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN(), etc.)
        SET Operation (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)
        Sub-Query

    ~> DCL (Data Control Language) : for Permission
        GRANT
        REVOKE

    ~> Data Type of SQLite :
        NULL
        INTEGER
        REAL / FLOAT / NUMERIC
        TEXT
        CHAR / VARCHAR
        BLOB


~> JDBC Drivers :

    [] Components of JDBC :

        DriverManager   :

        Driver          : 
            Java Program and Database Program are written in different language so directly connection not establish.
            we have to use Driver to build connection to two different language based program.
            Driver has some methods and APIs are used to establish connection.
            Driver conversion of data type.

            There are four types of Driver :
            ::Type 1
                JDBC-OBDC Bridge (partial) 
                ODBC is Neutral Data base.
            
            ::Type 2
                Native-API (partial)

            ::Type 3
                Java-Net Protocol Driver (pure)
                Java Driver not require to know how data conversion. Java Driver send data to intermediate.

            ::Type 4
                Thin Driver (pure)
                Java Driver direclty conncet to Oracle is called Pure Java Driver.
                Presently, Oracle Written in Java so Java Program directly work on it.

        Connection      :
            Using Driver, We connect two program.
            For Connection, java.sql package have Connection class.

        Statement       : for Executing statements, using Driver and Connection.

        ResultSet       : Where Result of Query are hold or store.

        SQLException    :

    
~> java.sql Package :

    DriverManager :
        It is used for establishing connection between java and database.
        It will utilise JDBC driver. 
        Class.forName() create object on fly. not available in program but it with JVM.

    Connection : 
        Through Driver Manager we will get conncetion of JDBC Driver and Database using Path of Database.
        Connection Object is used to create Statement.
        commit() is used to save modify table into database.
        close() is used to close conncetion.
        setAutoCommit() is used to automatic commit when DML is execute.

    ResultSet :
        When we require to execute query and store result then use ResultSet Object.
        It Store Result Set of Corresponding Query.

        next() is used to move to next one and no next then return false.
        There are some Get Method to get any type of data.

    Statement :
        Three Types of Statements :
            Statement
            PreparedStatement
            CallableStatement -> Stored Procedure

        PreparedStatement : 
            for taking input on runtime for Query.
            Passing Parameter.

[] important :
    for DML and DDL query we use executeUpdate() of Statement.
