~> What is Graphical User Interface ?
    Interface is point of communication.
    Set of commands and dialogues are used to communicate.

    So, Communicate with Computer System we require interface.
    Users are interact with interface so known as User Interface.

    There are two types of Interface.
        Character User Interface. : Windows Command Prompt
        Graphical User Interface. ex : Windows

    We can Develop Graphical User Interface in JAVA.
    1. AWT - Abstract Windows Toolkit
    2. Swings
    3. JavaFX

~> AWT : 
    Toolkit for developing Windows based application. This Tools are abstract.
    Looks and feels depending on OS.

~> Event Delagation Model :

    Components : All Components have :
        Properties
        Methods
        Event

    Listeners : (Interface)
        Event handle by this listeners.

~> When Which Event is generated ? 
    ActionEvent         ActionListener
    MouseEvent          MouseListener
    KeyEvent            KeyListener
    ItemEvent           ItemListener
    TextEvent           TextListener
    MouseWheelEvent     MouseWheelListener
    WindowEvent         WindowListener
    ComponentEvent      ComponentListener
    ContainerEVent      ContainerListener

~> Button, ActionEvent and ActionListener :

~> CheckBox, RadioButton, ItemEvent, ItemListener

~> Flow Layout :
    Flow Layout set Componenets in line by line.
    Default alignment for this layout is Center.

~> Border Layout :
    We have 4 side(North, South, East, West) and one Center.
    We can set only 5 Components.

~> Grid layout :
    Using Grid Layout , We can set Conponents in Tabuular form.
    In form of Column and Row.
    We can not empty cell anywhere.

~> GridBag Layout :
    Same Grid Layout.
    But, We can Empty Cell Anywhere.

~> Card Layout :
    Card based like View(Tab).

~> Key Event :

    Three Event of key pressing :
        KeyPressed (Press)
        KeyTyped   (Holding)
        KeyReleased(Released)

~> Mouse Event :

    MouseEntered
    MouseExited
    MouseClicked
    MousePressed
    MouseReleased
    MouseMoved
    MouseDragged

~> Windows Event :
    WindowOpened
    WindowClosing
    WindowClosed
    WindowIconified
    WindowDeiconfied
    WindowActivated
    WindowDeactivated

~> Adapter Classes :

    Adapter are use alternative of Listeners.

    In Interface, we must override all abstract method of interface.
    Overcome this problem, we can use Adapter Class.

~> Different Way for Handling Event
    Frame Class as Listener
    Inner Class
    Anonymous Class
    Lambda Expression

~> Menu :
    
~> Paint, Color, Font :

~> Animation :
    Animation is made by Multi threading.
