[] important :

    Responsibily of Programmer how data write to file and receive from file.

~> Files Vs Databse

    In file, We can not organise big data easily.
    This process is complex beacuse we can store big data in file but when we retrieve it difficult to access.

    In Databse, We can organise big data easily and retrieve it.
    Database Program is used to store permanent data to HDD(Disk).
    Database organise data in form of tabular.

~> What is Database ?
    Database is collection of Table.
    For retrieving data from table, we use Structure Query Language.

~> Famous Databases :

    Oracle
    MYSQL
    SQLServer
    SQLite

~> Databse Terminology :

    Relation : 
        A Relation is a table in a Relational Database.
        Relation= Table

        We have one table as Student.
        Then, Student is relation.

    Record :
        Top of table we find description of table. This Known as Schema of table.
        Baased on this Schema we insert records into table.
        Record means data in row(tuple) related to Schema of Table.

    Field :
        All the column in Data Table is known as Field(Attribute) of Table.

    Primary Key : 
        Primary Key is Column of Table which contains Unique Value and Not Null.
        Primary Key is a column in a table that uniquely identifies each row in table.

    Relationship : 
        A Relationship is an association between two or more tables based on common attributes.
        Typically using Primary and Foreign Key.

        Type of Relationship :
            1 : 1
            1 : N
            M : N

    Foreign Key :
        A Foreign key is a column in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.

    Constraints :
        Primary key and Foreign Key are  Constraints.
